                <p style={{ color: "lightgrey" }}>
                  The Artifact Keychain works by connecting the unique user to
                  the Artifact Marketplace via a QR code located on the back of
                  the device, here is where you can create a new profile and
                  connect your crypto wallet to verify your NFT collection. Once
                  verified you will be able to store COPIES of your NFT on the
                  Artifact device.{" "}

                  Safely upload personal health or emergency documents that can
                  be shown when your QR code on the back of your device is
                  scanned. This can protect you by giving you the option to
                  share critical information in an emergency regardless of
